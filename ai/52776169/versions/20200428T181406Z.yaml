description: |-
  RailwAI is an allround-AI that uses a realistic building style to compete your business!

  It randomly selects what cities or industries to connect, and loves to plant some trees on the map. If you like, you can put a limit on the company expansion drift in the settings.
  I hope you'll enjoy him as your opponent!
