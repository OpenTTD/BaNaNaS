  An AI that doesn't compete with you but rather builds out the highway network. Our (*new*) revenue stream is transporting offshore oil to oil refineries.

  v8 - bug fixes and minor improvements
  v7 - adds Operation Hibernia (transport oil from Oil Rigs to Oil Refineries);
  v6 - tries to build less roads and fixes a bug where WmDOT would crash if it couldn't build HQ;
  v5 - greatly increases startup speed on large maps
