  CluelessPlus is a simple but nice AI that makes bus routes.

  Clueless was the first user AI for NoAI published on tt-forums. CluelessPlus is Clueless that has been updated to work with current NoAI API. And since then there have been many improvements.

  v18:
  * Don't try to buy trams
  * Build something even if max loan is 100 000
  * Added one more possible tile slope for bridge conversion
