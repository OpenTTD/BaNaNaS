  CluelessPlus connects towns and industries using road transport. CluelessPlus tries to do its job without causing major jams for other transport companies using jam detection mechanisms.

  Clueless was the first user AI for NoAI published on tt-forums. CluelessPlus is Clueless that has been updated to work with current NoAI API. And since then there have been many improvements.

  v25:
  * New setting: build new connections nearby existing ones.
