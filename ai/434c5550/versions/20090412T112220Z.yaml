  Builds only bus routes between towns. Clueless was the first user AI for NoAI published on tt-forums. CluelessPlus is Clueless updated to work with current NoAI API. Extra in the Plus edition:
  1) Now it uses the library pathfinder
  2) plans before building stations -> less annoying for players
  3) buy/sell vehicles based on number of waiting passengers and rating.

  NOTE: Does not support save/load! (stop doing anything on load)
