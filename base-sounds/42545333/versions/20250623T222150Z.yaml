name: "British Train Sounds GWR"
description: "This is the BritishTrainSoundsGWR Sound Set that replaces the OpenSFX standard train whistles and horns with British ones. This also replaces the railway crossing sound. 1.0.1 brings a decrease to the volume on the level crossing sound as it was a bit too loud before."
