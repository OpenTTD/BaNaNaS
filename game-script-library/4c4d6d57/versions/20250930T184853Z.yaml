  Minchinweb's MetaLibrary is an GS library written to support WmDOT but I hope it will be useful to others. This version has the same functions as the AI version, but modified for GameScripts. (v.11-GS) [2025-09-30]

  Sublibraries include:
  * Road Pathfinder,
  * Dominion Land System (pathfinder),
  * Ship Pathfinder,
  * Spiral Walker,
  * Line Walker,
  * Lakes (water body check),
  * Log,
  * Array,
  * Atlas,
  * Marine,
  * Engines (selection), and
  * Extras
