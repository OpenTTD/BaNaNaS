  As you might know CluelessPlus, PAXLink, TownCars and TutorialAI are all created by the same author. To reduce code duplication among these AIs, this library has been created. As a bonus, other AI authors can also use the library.

  SuperLib contains functions for
  * Simplifying tasks (tiles, direction, signs, money ..)
  * Get better understanding of the world (vehicle, engine, industry, town, airport ..)
  * Build infrastructure (road, station, airport, ..)
  * A log system
