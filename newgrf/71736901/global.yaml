  Quasi's Modular Station Buildings offers generic modular station buildings for your small to medium-sized towns. Or for your large towns â€” I won't judge.

  All buildings in this set are objects, which means you'll find them in your objects menu, not your stations menu. This groups all four orientations conveniently together.
