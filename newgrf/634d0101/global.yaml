  Better bridges parameters:
  1. first grid, suspension and cantilever bridge available in half of XIX century;
  2. spread and ratio of speeds and costs, tweaked for TTRS/TBRS/ARRS
  3. base costs of bridge construction, ground levelling, tunnel building and water clearing increased slightly;
  4. similar properties of road suspension and rail cantilever bridges;
  5. short bridges can be 4 tiles long (+ 2 bridge heads);
  6. silicon bridge for very fast trains (vacuum tube etc).
