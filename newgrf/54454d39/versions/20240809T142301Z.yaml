description: |-
  This is the beta version of my industries set, I recommend using it with my 32bpp townset named "Real Houses Townset" for a better 32bpp experience.

  It is only a Beta version and some things need to be polished / fixed.

  Changelog 4.0.1:

  - Cargo name fixed: Fuel Oil instead Petrol.
  - Tyres, Plastics and Rubber are now GOODS instead LIQUID.

  Enjoy!
