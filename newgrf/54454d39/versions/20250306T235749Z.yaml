description: |-
  This is the beta version of my industries set, I recommend using it with "Real Houses Townset" for a better 32bpp experience.

  Changelog 4.0.2:

  - Adjusted Payment rates and Production values.
  - Adjusted industries distance to towns.
  - Players cargo its working now.
  - Some Industries now produce by default, Qualified Workers increase the production, and Heavy Vehicles even more but they are no longer strictly necessary to produce as before.

  Enjoy!
