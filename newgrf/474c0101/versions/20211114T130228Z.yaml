description: |-
  This NewGRF contains two hybrid electric/diesel locomotives and one hybrid electric/battery locomotive. They can run in diesel/battery mode on non-electrified tracks, but are more powerful and have a cheaper running cost when run in electric mode on electrified tracks.

  Graphics are based on the Millenium Z1 by the OpenGFX team, licensed under the GPL v2.
