name: "Cursor / GUI Replacer"
description: |-
  Do you dislike the orange cursor that comes in OpenGFX? Wish it was white instead? Me too!

  This simple NewGRF replaces the cursor with a white one, greatly increasing visibility (in most situations).

  It can also optionally replace the rest of the GUI to look like OpenGFX too, if you're using another base graphics set but want the same old feel.

  Please read the readme! It contains important instructions on how to use this correctly (and not waste a NewGRF slot)!
