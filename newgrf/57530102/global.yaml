  WenSim's Eyecandy Signals
  =========================

  This GRF adds a few eyecandy objects that can be used as signals.

  WES requires OpenTTD JGRPP 0.40.0 or later to work properly. WES WILL NOT WORK WITH VANILLA OPENTTD.

  IT IS KNOWN THAT WES CONTAINS A BOUNDING BOX BUG:
  The bounding box of a signal is very small, and oftentimes the object will collide with catenary wires.
  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND CANNOT BE FIXED.
