name: "Maglev Track Set v2 reMOD"
description: "reldreds custom fork of the Maglev Track Set. This one has a few more major differences compared to my other forks, these are in the form, of updated graphics as well as a bunch of new parameters. Also added pixel-perfect fences courtesy of Emperor Jake of the JP+ Crew. These match pixel perfect with JP+ Bridges and are intended to be used with my fork of the DPRK Track Set, Industrial Track Set, and Trackless Track set."
