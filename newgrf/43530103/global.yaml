description: "Country Roads aims to provide two tracks that fit into rural settings. It contains a farming or field track and a forestry track. Both feature graphics for temperate, arctic (including alpine) and desert climate, as well as snow. The forestry track can be used by heavy hauling vehicles. Both tracks are designed for off road vehicles, but can be configured to work with common road vehicles, too."
