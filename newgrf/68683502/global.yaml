name: "Short French Town Names"
description: |-
  A list of over 5,800 names of places in France that are at most six letters long. This list was created using data taken from GeoNames (https://www.geonames.org/about/)
  GeoNames is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
  The data was mostly used as-is, but I may have removed a tiny number of place names that would, in my opinion, be inappropriate or confusing in the context of OpenTTD.
