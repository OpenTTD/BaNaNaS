description: |-
  Road Hog!  A big fat road vehicle set.

  Alpha versions have many broken things in them.

  This one is better than the ones before though.

  alpha-9 fixes a serious loading speed bug in alpha-8 (some vehicles wouldn't load at all).

  Not savegame compatible with previous alpha versions.
