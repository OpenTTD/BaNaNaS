name: "Raise landscaping costs"
description: |-
  This GRF raises by 4x all landscaping related costs without altering the cost of building foundations. It also includes four parameters, which allow to change the costs:

  1: Raise / lower land.
  2: Clear grass / rough land / rocks / field / water.
  3: Build foundations.
  4: Plant / remove trees.

  The default value for every cost is 8. A value of 7 will halve the cost, 9 will duplicate the it, 10 will multiply it by four and so on.
