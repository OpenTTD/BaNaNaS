description: |-
  JP+ Bridges, a variety of bridges inspired by real Japanese bridges. This version is designed to match JapanSet3: Tracks, however any other track set will work. Vanilla rails are not compatible as there are no graphics.

  Many bridges are full tile width for building side by side modular bridges.
