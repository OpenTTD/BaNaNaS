  Wasteland is (Open)TTD re-imagined in a post-apocalyptic setting, featuring unique gameplay focused on rebuilding towns from the smoldering ashes of a future war.

  Currently this set is a work in progress and is in need of players to help test it! Core gameplay is working and road vehicles are now available to transport cargoes.
