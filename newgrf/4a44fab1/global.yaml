  The New Company Colours Set. Enhances and improves upon the default company colours.
  - New colours include black, dark red, rust brown and military green
  - Full 2CC support - compatible with all company coloured sets, even 32bpp (somehow)
  - Allows you to represent much more realistic liveries
  - As a side-effect, some colours in the GUI are changed, but everything is still perfectly readable
