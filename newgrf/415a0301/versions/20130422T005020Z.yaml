description: |-
  Provides new road infrastructure graphics based on the road design used in The United States of America. Replaces all road tiles, including bridges, tunnels, level crossings, and more.

  Designed to work with OpenGFX, including support for OpenGFX+ Landscape. Original TTD graphics are not supported, though use of other NewGRFs can minimize the problems. See readme for details.
