description: |-
  ABRS provides a unique set of bridges for use in OpenTTD, intended
  to be used together with American Road Replacement Set (but not necessary).

  It is a work in progress but is fully playable, and as of this release
  includes 11 unique bridges across 7 bridge slots, with more to be added later!
