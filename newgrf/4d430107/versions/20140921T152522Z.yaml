description: |-
  Set of Polish trams from 1912 till 2014 (Sanok, Konstal, Alstom, Bombardier, Pesa and others manufacturers), drawn by Sojita, McZapkie and Voyager-1, versions 7 and higher coded in NML by McZapkie.
  Purchased single trams have option to buy trailers via refit menu.
  Note: huge capacity is counted including standing places, therefore reduced comfort must be taken into account - use with caution, for massive urban transit only.
  Running costs of fast trams depend on speed.
