description: |-
  Set of Polish trams from 1912 till 2014 (Sanok, Konstal, Alstom, Bombardier and others manufacturers), drawn by Sojita, version 7 coded in NML by McZapkie.
  Autorefit option compatible with ECS (tourists).
  Purchased single trams have option to buy trailers via refit menu.
  Note: huge capacity is counted including standing places, therefore reduced comfort must be taken into account - use with caution, for massive urban transit only.
