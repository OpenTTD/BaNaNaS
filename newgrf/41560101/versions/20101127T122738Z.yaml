description: |-
  AveiMil's Possibly Improved Gameplay Mod! Not a simple base costs mod but a mod designed to make the game balanced and challenging. The goal is to make all methods of transportation financially viable and have the map dictate which transportation method is more profitable.

  All vehicles and building costs have been completely rebalanced.

  Dedicated Servers are online as well.
