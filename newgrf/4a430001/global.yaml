  POSTED BY DAVE W. ALL ENQUIRIES TO HIM.

  These are mph's British Station tiles. The URL below leads to a post explaining all. But in summary...

  mph has not posted on the forum for three years, and as one of the few who he sent a copy of this set to, I have been inundated with requests whenever I post any screenshot in which they are included.

  Taking the above into account I am posting this file here AS IS.
