description: "reldreds custom fork of the Industrial Track Set. At the moment the only major difference is custom pixel-perfect fences courtesy of EmperorJake of the JP+ Crew. These match pixel perfect with JP+ Bridges and are intended to be used with my fork of the DPRK Track Set, Trackless Track Set, and Maglev Track Set."
