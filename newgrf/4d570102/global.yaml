name: "Hover Bus"
description: |-
  A futuristic hover bus available from 2030 onwards. It will reach very high speeds when used on a long, straight road. Since the capacity is rather low and the running costs high, it will only be profitable on routes where it can make use of its speed.

  This grf is based on the extended generic road vehicle and tram set (eGRVTS) by Zephyris (http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=33415) and can be used together with that set, or alone.
