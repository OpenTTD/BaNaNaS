name: "Italian Modern Trainset"
description: |-
  Includes some modern italian trains from Trenitalia and Trenitalia TPER (the operator in Emilia-Romagna region). This is far from complete, but it should contain enough trains to be able to have a good game without further additions.

  For further information please read the readme file.
