name: "Omni-Gauge Railtype"
description: |-
  Omni-gauge track is a fictional track setup with rails for 3000mm gauge, Iberian/Indian gauge, 1524mm Russian gauge, 1435mm Standard gauge, 1067mm and 1000mm narrow gauge, and 600mm Decauville.

  It looks a bit ugly from trying to overlay all the sprites, but it's mostly to be used in place of countless gauge combinations that would otherwise be necessary.

  An electrified omni-gauge track is also included for a bit of realism in an otherwise unrealistic set.
