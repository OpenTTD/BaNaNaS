description: "A trackset for use with Industrial Stations Renewal, CHIPS, Auz Freight Stations, the North Korean trainset, or JapanSet tracks, to fill up holes left by, for instance, diagonal tracks, or for a smoother transition elsewhere. It adds tracks that will serve to fill in the ground that is left as grass."
