description: "This set aims to totally overhaul railroads from 1863 - 1950 by introducing representative classes of every type of locomotive, passenger car, freight car, and caboose operated by the Southern Pacific Lines during that period. All stats and dimensions are taken from company blueprints, and this set aims to be as realistic as possible within the OpenTTD engine."
