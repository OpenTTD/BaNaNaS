name: "Future Road Vehicles Set"
description: "Originally concieved as a template for articulated road vehicles, this set evolved into a reuse of one of Nekomaster's old NABI bus sprites to create a vehicle capable of interacting with futuristic roads. It has now been combined with Hazzard's Hover Vehicles to provide more utility, as nether set added much on its own."
