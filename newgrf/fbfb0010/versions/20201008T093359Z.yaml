description: "2CC Trams brings real-world trams, streetcars, road-running interurbans and lightrail vehicles into OpenTTD. Featuring realistic capacities and speeds, these vehicles will compete with any train or road vehicle, and will provide great value and flexibility to your transport operations. Vehicles become available in the early 1870s and extend through the early 21st Century, featuring OpenTTD's dual company color (2CC) schemes and NRT support."
