  Instead of special houses, town industries are provided as terminals (water tower, workshop, bdmt storage, petrol station, car dealer, market).
  These industries are relatively cheap (must replace houses, only one industry per town, two per city).
  Cargo stockpile is limited (this option can be switched off) and cargo consumption rate depend on town population. Another additional industry is tar kiln - produce charcoal and refined products in wood burner, and ports (offer ore for coal etc)
