  The Snow-Aware Coastline Objects are an eyecandy new-object set that can be used to make coasttiles look snow-aware when the time is right.
  The tiles are slope-aware to make it easier for them to be placed.
  Available for Arctic and Alpine and with a choice of two snow-stages.
  Make sure to set the minimum snow-line in OpenGFX+Landscape to 0.
