name: "Modified Bridge Properties"
description: "Placed after the last bridge(set) in the newgrf list this grf will modify the base price and top speed for all bridges. --- I choose to modify the top speed to get a better spread and then let the price be directly related to the top speed. --- Furthermore some building costs are affected too (compared to the base price): * Raise bridge building cost (x64). * Raise tunnel building cost (x32). * Raise terraforming cost (x32)."
