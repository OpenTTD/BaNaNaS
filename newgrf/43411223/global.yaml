name: "Iron Horse 4 (Trains)"
description: |-
  Iron Horse 4.

  Comprehensive train set with a gameplay focus.

  Inspired (mostly) by British and Irish trains.

  It's mostly done and it's kind of fun.

  Designed to be used with 'vehicles expire' set to to 'on', Iron Horse 4 has a *lot* of vehicles and crowds the buy menu unless expiry is used.

  Earliest start: around 1860
  Last new trains introduced: around 2020

  Also includes narrow gauge and metro trains and railtypes.
