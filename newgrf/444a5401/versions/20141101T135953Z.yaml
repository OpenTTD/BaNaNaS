description: |-
  Contains many new track types, each with a different speed limit and cost that can both be adjusted.

  r247: Cost adjustment parameters, much better implementation than the first version of NuTracks
  r242: Minimap colors to distinguish all those track types.
  r239: Sorting order added.
  r237: Alignment problems fixed.
