name: "Ultimate Cargo Payment Override"
description: |-
  Can change all 64 cargo payment rates,
  no matter the industry...

  Does NOT change payment decay.
  Check `SimpleCargoDecayOverride` for that.

  Howto:
  - place as last NewGRF
  - toggle console ~ or ` or (?)
  - type "dump_info cargotypes"
  - find all the cargo IDs to change.

  Usually its
  00 PASS
  01 COAL
  02 MAIL
  etc...

  Default payment values in the readme.txt or OTTD wiki
