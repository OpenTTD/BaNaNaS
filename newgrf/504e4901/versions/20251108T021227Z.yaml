description: |-
  Are you easily confused by vanilla industry cargo coverage?

  This NewGRF makes vanilla industries accept cargo on any tile instead of requiring specific tiles to be covered.

  You no longer have to look at the Accepts/Supplies section of the build window (assuming you already know which cargo types an industry accepts.)
