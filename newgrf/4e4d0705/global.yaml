  The "The North American Track Set"

  A grf designed to include
  more North American styled railroad
  tracks to OpenTTD with various
  speed classes and even narrow gauge.

  The track set also includes custom
  signal graphics and in the future
  will include generational depot
  graphics.

  Costs are also tweaked for larger
  games where costs can become an
  issue but players can change the
  costs via the Parameters to make
  the tracks cost more or less.

  ~ SHOULD BE COST BALENCED NOW! ~
