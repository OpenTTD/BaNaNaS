  A continually-expanding list of fictional cities, towns and villages. Has the Public Domain Mark to ensure it will never be unavailable to the end user.

  The Plus version includes names from fandoms (Touhou, Tabletop RPGs) and names from unpublished works contributed by creative people I have permision from, or who are in the community and ask nicely ;).
