  v0.4 John Franklin Fork: add JFRattRoads support.

  SUV (Supplemental Unsurfaced Road Vehicle Set) supplies your OTTD game with a set of multi-purpose off-road trucks (and SUVs ...), which can run on various Road Types. This makes the vehicles of this set the all-rounders you need on your strife to create a vast web of (bumpy) country roads.

  This set needs dirt Road Types to fully work (see readme.txt).
