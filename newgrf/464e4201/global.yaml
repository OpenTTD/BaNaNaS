  This is a first attempt at creating some plausible random Faroese town names.
  I knew next to nothing about programming (still don't) and even less about the nml/grf process when I started dabbling in this a couple of days ago, so excuse the simplicity.

  I owe a great deal to William Minchin and his "Random, Alberta-based Town Names for OpenTTD" which is the .nml file I mangled into this and also thanks to the OpenTTD forums and chat.
