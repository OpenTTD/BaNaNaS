name: "Valuables for Arctic & Tropical"
description: |-
  This NewGRF modifies the arctic and tropical banks so that they produce and accept valuables, in addition to accepting gold or diamonds. It can also be used in combination with FIRS in any climate to re-enable banks.

  NOTE: You must have the NewGRF "ECS & FIRS vehicle set" or something similar in order to have vehicles that can transport valuables in arctic and tropical climates.

  Graphics for banks are from OpenGFX. Graphics for banks under construction are from FIRS. Both are licensed under the GPL v2.
