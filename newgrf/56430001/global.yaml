name: "Total Town Replacement Set"
description: |-
  A house set intended for temperate climate, but compatible with all climates. Contains over 100 new buildings. The buildings are separated into four "eras": before 1950, 1950-1980, 1980-2010 and 2010-forever, making the look of towns evolve over time. Also replaces the graphic of the roads, bridges and temperate bank by default.
