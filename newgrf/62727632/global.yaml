name: "British Rail UK Set (BRTrains)"
description: |-
  A UK Train and Tram set, with real world units and liveries

  This set aims for realism and completeness, with a goal to include every real world unit and livery from the British National Rail network. If it ran/runs on the UK railway network, it's probably in this set (or will be in future)

  Multiple units are in real-world consist lengths, units are painted in real world liveries. Use the refit menu in the depot to choose additional liveries
