name: "Original Industries Disabler"

  Disables default industries.

  Useful, for example, when you want to play with a specific ECS vector, but don't want to use the Town vector.
  Or maybe you just want to deliver lots of coal to a power station without any distractions.

  Use at your own risk.

  ----------------------

  This version has a parameter for each industry.

  If you order now we'll also throw in a set of steak knives!
