  Tea Tea Deluxe adds tea to OpenTTD!

  Tea tree farms produce tea leaves. Deliver them to tea factories asap. The luxurious Tea Tea Deluxe is created in the factories and enjoyed in teahouses in civilised cities.

  Version 1.2.0 adds custom train carriages, and should therefore work on older versions of the game that don't have refittable goods wagons.
