name: "ISR/DWE-style Objects II /dirty"
description: |-
  Quast65's 'ISR/DWE-style Objects' refurbished.
  Contains tiles from ISR/DWE stations, dock- and road-overlapping tiles etc., all updated to be compatible with Brickblock1's 'CHIPS style dock objects'.
  Objects automatically adapt to land/water; no maddening multiselect; use parameters to switch between two types of dirty concrete (CHIPS or ISR).
