name: "Italian Electric Locos Pack 3"
description: "This pack represents the third generation of Italian electric railway locomotives, those powered by 3kV DC and with chopper (PWM) DC motor controls. Of the same generation are also the unique E491/492 \"Senapine\" locomotives, powered by 25 kV AC. Those never entered service, so the sound is my personal recreation and not an actual recording ;)"
