description: |-
  From 'Acme' to 'Zama City,' this is a collection of 1500+ real Alberta, Canada place names. They were taken from cities, towns, villages, hamlets and neighbourhoods around the province and all exist! Although strong English roots show, French and First Nations (Indian) names figure prominently as well.
