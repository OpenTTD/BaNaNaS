description: |-
  This pack contains some Italian diesel locomotives.

  It contains:
  - D.443
  - D.445
  - D.449
  - D.744 'Effishunter 1000'

  The D.449 is a diesel locomotive for freight duties. It was built by rebuilding an existing D.343. It never entered active service and was sadly scrapped after only 1000 km of trial runs.
