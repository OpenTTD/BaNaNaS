name: "U&RaTT: Hard Mode"
description: |-
  Add "Hard Mode" for U&RaTT, where the speed limits of asphalt roads are reduced, towns only build urban asphalt roads (as of 0.8.2), and Class A asphalt roads do not allow houses.
  Add Simplified Chinese translation.

  Many thanks to Ufiby for the original roadset. Under GPL v3.
