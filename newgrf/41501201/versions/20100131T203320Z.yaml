description: "\"Heavy Equipment\" road vehicle set   I like big trucks and thought it would be nice to have some for OpenTTD, so I created HEQS.  What's included in HEQS?  *Nine* enormous dump trucks (first available 1955)  *Two* awesome log trucks (available around 1972)  *Ten* powerful tractors and bulldozers (first available 1937)  (new) *Two* Foundry Transporters (first available 1967).  HEQS 0.6 has good-looking vehicles in a range of sizes from 19t to 252t.  Compatible with FIRS, PBI and ECS."
