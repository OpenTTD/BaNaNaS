  "Heavy Equipment" road vehicle set

  I like big trucks and I thought it would be nice to have some for OpenTTD, so I created HEQS.

  What's included in HEQS?
  - *Nine* enormous dump trucks (first one available around 1955)
  - *Two* awesome log trucks (available around 1972)
  - *Ten* powerful tractors and bulldozers (first one available around 1937)

  HEQS 0.5e has good-looking vehicles in a range of sizes from 19t to 252t.

  Compatible with FIRS, PBI and ECS.  Works well with eGRVTS.
