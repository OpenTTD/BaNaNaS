description: |-
  The Heavy Equipment Set (HEQS) is a road vehicle set featuring trucks, tractors and heavy equipment for mining, logging, farming and other specialised uses.

  It includes some vehicles that are just plain useful, some very large vehicles which radically change the gameplay possibilities of road vehicles, and some things that are mostly eye candy, but can haul cargo profitably.

  Changes in 0.5c:
  New vehicles - Cascade C10 and C16 Logging Trucks
  Graphic support for FIRS sand cargo
