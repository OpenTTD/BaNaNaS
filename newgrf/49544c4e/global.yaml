name: "Italian Town Names"
description: |-
  This NewGRF is a collection of Italian city names. There are a little more than 200 city names here. The bigger cities, such as Roma and Milano, are given more weight,  and therefore are more likely to appear during the game creation.
  Please note that all the names are displayed in their real italian name.

  Thank you for downloading my pack,
  have fun
