name: "UFCF Metro Train"
description: |-
  A NewGRF that adds the UFCFMT - an Unrealistically Fast and Capacious Fictional Metro Train. Adds three new trains: a dual-headed engine, powered wagon, and unpowered wagon. They're all super OP.

  It's still a little rough around the edges, but hope you guys enjoy it! It's my first NewGRF.
