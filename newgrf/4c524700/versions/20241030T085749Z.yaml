name: "UFCF Metro Train"
description: |-
  A NewGRF that adds the UFCFMT - an Unrealistically Fast and Capacious Fictional Metro Train - coded as a dual-headed engine. WIP

  It's still a little rough around the edges, but hope you guys enjoy it! It's my first NewGRF.

  Updated to fix sprites and tweak horsepower rating.
