  Iron Horse 2.

  It ain't done but it's kind of fun.

  Stick to 1950-2050.  Trains introduced before 1950 may have unfinished sprites.

  Designed to be used with 'vehicles expire' set to to 'on', Horse 2 has a *lot* of vehicles and crowds the buy menu unless expiry is used.

  Not savegame compatible with previous 2.0.0-Alpha releases.
