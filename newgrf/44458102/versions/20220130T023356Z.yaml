  Why not take a winter vacation to Honolulu with Hale!

  Hale is 8 houses, 4 apartment buildings, 6 offices and one temple/church to replace the equivalent existing sprite in the base set. The sprites are drawn by myself, and each is inspired by a real building or buildings somewhere in Honolulu, mostly Downtown, Mo'ili'ili, Waikiki and Kahala thus far. This version of this GRF is intended to function as a static grf, so you can use it multiplayer games that use tropic maps with no Newgrfs loaded.
