description: |-
  Set of 4 replacements of original bridges in 32bpp designed to fit with other CZTR Sets. Set is released as only temporary measure.

  WARNING: Cantilever bridges are designed for maximum bridgelenght of 6, otherwise they look unrealistically strong because of the offset supports! (WIP though)
