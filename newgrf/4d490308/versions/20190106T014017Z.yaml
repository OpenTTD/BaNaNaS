  Set of 5 replacements of original RAILROAD bridges in 32bpp designed to fit with other CZTR Sets. Set is released as only temporary measure.

  WARNING: Cantilever bridges are designed for maximum bridgelenght of 6, otherwise they look unrealistically strong because of the invisible pillars! (still WIP though). WIP in many areas, in fact :D
