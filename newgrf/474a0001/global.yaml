name: "Total Town Replac. Set Early Mo"
description: |-
  This is a modification of the excellent Total Town Replacement Set 3.14 by Zimmlock, et al. I just modified the NFO code a little.

  This version modifies the introduction date of several buildings, making this set suitable to start a game as early as 1700. Also, the population of several buildings was also reduced to values that make more sense, allowing for smaller towns in the beginning of the game and delaying giant metropolis in the XIX century.
