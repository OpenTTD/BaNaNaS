description: "The Metro Track Set adds third rail tracks to OpenTTD and TTDPatch and is originally designed to complement the metros of the 2cc Trainset. It will add Metro Tracks as a new railtype to OpenTTD or at your option replace monorail or maglev with Metro Tracks instead. It can be used with any train set that includes third rail vehicles."
