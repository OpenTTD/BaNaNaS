description: |-
  The Metro Track Set adds third rail tracks to OpenTTD and TTDPatch and is originally designed to complement the metros of the 2cc Trainset. It will add Metro Tracks as a new railtype to OpenTTD or at your option replace monorail or maglev with Metro Tracks instead. It can be used with any train set that includes third rail vehicles.

  OpenTTD 1.0.3 or recent nightly recommended.
