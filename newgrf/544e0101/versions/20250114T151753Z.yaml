  2cc Narrow Gauge Trains in NML

  A fork of 2ccNML to support narrow gauge trains, with new engines and additional bugfixes. Requires a narrow-gauge track set (U&ReMM2, Termite, ...). Works in conjunction with the original 2cc Trains in NML, but can be used as a standalone provider of narrow-gauge engines.
