name: "Wolfie's Extension Train Set"
description: |-
  An addon for Timberwolf's UK Trains with mostly random
  stuff that I thought would look good and enhance the vibe.

  Some of the content is to fill little gaps in the set,
  some of it is just for fun.

  There is a parameter to disable the silliest parts of the set if you want.
