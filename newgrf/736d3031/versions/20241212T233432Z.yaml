description: |-
  This mod is a fork "Very large ships", which is a mod of user "Bilbo". Thanks for that!

  Modified parameters of the ships. They are now faster and have higher capacities.

  Big ships now have a max speed of 80 km/h.
  Small ships now have a max speed of 100 km/h.
  (Except hovercraft with 125 km/h max speed).

  Big ships have a capacity of 1000 tons/passengers/thousand liters.
  Small ships have a capacity of 100 tons/passengers/thousand liters.
  (Except hover craft with 50 passengers capacity.)
