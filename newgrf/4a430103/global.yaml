description: |-
  The EB740 is an electric railcar built in 1951 by the Ferrovie Nord Milano (FNM). It can be run in multiple units and is capable to pull multiple passenger coaches. Essentially, it's a locomotive with passenger seats :)

  Loosely based on the sprites of the Manley-Morel DMU by the OpenGFX Team.

  Please report any bugs on the Github page.
