name: "Dystopian Town Names"
description: |-
  A bleak and immersive dystopian name generator for OpenTTD.
  This set procedurally combines industrial-style prefixes and suffixes
  with numbered sectors, zones, and blocks â€” producing names like
  "Rustholm", "Blastford", "Voidgrad-77", or "Oblivion City-91".

  Perfect for cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, or industrial-themed playthroughs.
