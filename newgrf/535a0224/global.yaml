name: "Speed for suspension bridges!"
description: |-
  For those of us who like default bridges (graphics), speed upgrades for default suspension bridges and the girder "pothole" bridge are in order.
  Concrete: 80 -> 144kph.
  Bronze - steel: 96 -> 160kph.
  Golden - steel: 112 -> 224kph.
  Girder pothole-cover bridge: 256 -> 448kph.
