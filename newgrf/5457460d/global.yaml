name: "Timberwolf's Bridge Tweaks"
description: |-
  A small set of tweaks to the default game bridges, to provide better aesthetic variety and more gameplay options.

  This aligns bridges closer to their real-world introduction dates, rebalances speeds to improve early game options and avoid the "single best bridge" effect, and makes faster bridges significantly more expensive.
