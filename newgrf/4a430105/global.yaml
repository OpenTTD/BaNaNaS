name: "Stadler GTW (Trenord ATR115/125"
description: |-
  The Stadler series of DMUs was purchased by Trenord in 2011 and called ATR 115 (GTW 2/6) and ATR 125 (GTW 4/12).
  This NewGRFs contains both ATRs.
  The ATR 115 is used on the Brescia-Iseo line in a rural context. ATR125s are used more widely on the network, mostly based in Cremona, Pavia and on the Milano-Besana S9 suburban line where they are called "Besanino".

  Please report any bugs or suggestions as I am still learning to code and draw NewGRFs.
