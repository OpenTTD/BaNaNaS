description: |-
  Industry and miscellaneous tiles as objects, to expand and prettify/grungify your industrial areas. You don't need FIRS or CHIPS to use this NewGRF, but why wouldn't you use them?

  Graphics used: FIRS and CHIPS by andythenorth, FooBar, planetmaker, Terkhen, Yexo and many others.
  Some graphical edits and variants by me.
