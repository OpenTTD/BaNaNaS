  Eyecandy Road Vehicles for OTTD!
  Currently featuring an Ambulance, Fire Engine, Police Car, Tow Truck, USPS-Style Mail Truck, Garbage Trucks, and Horse & Rider, all with zero purchase and running costs. The emergency vehicles also have flashing lights and sirens. These vehicles are not intended to be practical cargo-carriers, but just to make your cities and roads look nicer.

  This GRF is fully compatible with TownCarsAI.

  See the included readme for more complete information.
