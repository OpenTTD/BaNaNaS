  THIS IS TOTALLY OBSOLETE WITH JP+ ENGINES 0.12.4 UPDATE. DON'T USE IT SINCE IT COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS.

  You can use it to fix the low reliability of engines and increase the cargo aging period of wagons in JP+ Engines and Wagons. LOAD IT AFTER JP+ ENGINES AND WAGONS!!! John Franklin, 30 Apr 2023. Thanks to EmperorJake.
