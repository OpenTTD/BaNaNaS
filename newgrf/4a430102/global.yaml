description: |-
  The Ansaldo/TIBB E652 is an electric locomotive built in 1989 for mixed traffic duties. Its very high power of 5600kW and Bo'Bo'Bo' configuration makes it very versatile and capable.

  Model based on graphics from the X2001 of the OpenGFX team, licensed under the GPLv2.

  Please report any bugs on the github, as this is my first NewGRF using NML. :)
