name: "VACE - VTOL AirCraft for Everyo"
description: "VTOL - Vertical Take-Off and Landing. Aircraft that go straight up and down, no runway needed! Kind of like a helicopter, but faster and with better range. This is a mix of real and fictional aircraft. Real aircraft include those in production, those that were tested but never went into production, and those that are on the drawing boards. Fictional aircraft include some based around real world technologies and some that are a bit more fanciful."
