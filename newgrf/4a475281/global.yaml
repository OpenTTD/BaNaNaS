  Multi Aspect Signals

  This GRF includes 4-aspect signal graphics (red, yellow, double-yellow, green) for the block signal, PBS and one-way PBS signal types (light signals not semaphores).

  This GRF requires an OpenTTD version which supports this feature such as JGR's patchpack v0.43.0 or later.

  Realistic braking must be enabled for extra signal aspects to be used.

  This GRF also has a parameter (default off) to provide custom signal styles.
  (Requires JGR's patchpack v0.48.0 or later).
