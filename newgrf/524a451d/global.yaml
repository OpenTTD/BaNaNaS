name: "Trackless Trackset reMOD"
description: "reldreds custom fork of the Trackless Trackset. At the moment the only major difference is custom pixel-perfect fences courtesy of EmperorJake of the JP+ Crew. These match pixel perfect with JP+ Bridges and are intended to be used with my fork of the DPRK Track Set, Industrial Track set, and Maglev Track Set."
