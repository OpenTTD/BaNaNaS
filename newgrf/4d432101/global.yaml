name: "HotHut"
description: |-
  Replacement for tropical house set,
  based on default houses with altered properties,
  with many new houses added.
  Early houses spawn depend on terrain:
  African-inspired wattle huts in rainforest,
  stilt houses near river, Middle-East clay houses on desert.
  Some houses classes should appear as distinctive clusters, for example separate slums or residential districts.
  Additional settings for street lamps and pavement replacement.
