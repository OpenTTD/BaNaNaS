name: "Rock Replacement for Transmitte"
description: |-
  Ever play a 19th-century game and get annoyed by the fact that there are
  RADIO TRANSMITTERS in an era where such objects were not even available,
  let alone prevalent? Or just completely annoyed by these tall, unmovable
  structures in general? This NewGRF simply replaces the default transmitter
  graphic for a rock. Yes. Simple, gray, and also unmovable unless you use
  the cheat menu.
