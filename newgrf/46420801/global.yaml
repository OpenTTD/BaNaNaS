  New Tram Tracks is a tramway replacement set featuring grass-embedded off-road tracks and single-sided wire supports for the overhead wires.

  Additionally, the player can choose between two types of wire supports: the set's default single-sided wire supports or an alternative with slightly slimmer poles.
