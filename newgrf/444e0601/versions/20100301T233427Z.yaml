description: |-
  Monorail Infrastructure Conversion Set
  A graphics set based on OpenGFX that replaces the monorail tracks, tunnels, level crossings and depots to have a more urban feel. Supports snow-covered tracks above the snowline in Arctic and sand-covered tracks in Subtropical. Set the first parameter to 1 to disable this behaviour - see the readme in the relevant thread for more information.
