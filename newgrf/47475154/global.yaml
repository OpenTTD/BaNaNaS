name: "OTIS - One Tile Industry Set"
description: |-
  The game starts with no Industries available.
  CHECK THE README OR DEVELOPMENT WEBSITE FOR THE REQUIRED GAME SETTINGS!!
  You have to buy and place the tile representing the Industry you want.
  The 1 tile industries can easily be hidden behind nicer looking structures and then stimulate traffic to areas where you otherwise wouldn't have that.
  There are just 8 different industries accepting and producing a total of 64 cargo's, so you can have many different looking vehicles visiting them.
