name: "Water Treatment Plant"
description: |-
  This NewGRF adds a water treatment plant industry for the tropical climate. It also improves the standard water supplies so that they don't close down.

  This NewGRF is compatible with FIRS. If you use it with FIRS, it also re-enables the standard water supply and water tower industries.

  NOTE: If you use FIRS, for this NewGRF to work as expected, it must be after FIRS in the "Active NewGRF-files" list.

  Graphics are based on various graphics by OpenGFX and FIRS, both licensed under the GPL v2.
