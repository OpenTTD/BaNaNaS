  **THIS GRF IS OBSOLETE**
  **Use Version 1.1**
  ISR/DWE-style objects is a feature that has loads of graphics converted from the ISR and DWE stations-sets to objects. Also a lot of new features, like dock- and road-overlapping tiles, drive-through tiles and new graphics.
  Recommended is to use it in combination with the ISR-style dock GRF that provides an empty dock, so that you can change the appearance of the dock via dock overlapping tiles.
