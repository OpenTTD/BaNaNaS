name: "The Lighthouse Set"
description: "The Lighthouse Set is an object set (eyecandy-set) for openTTD. The lighthouses are not exact copies of real life lighthouses, but they are drawn with more or less inspiration from the real lighthouses primarily in the Nordic countries. The Lighthouse Set has no other function than being an eyecandy in openTTD. The Lighthouse Set contains by now 14 lighthouses, with either rock/grass or ISR (concrete)-basetile."
