name: "Czech Road set"
description: |-
  This set contains road vehicles used in the Czech Republic (formerly Czechoslovakia), especially of Czech production.
  Vehicles can be refited into various versions. Graphics are in 32bpp and in future you can look forward to trucks and trams (from CS Salin Set). The scale for vehicles is derived from another my set od trains (Czech Railways set).
