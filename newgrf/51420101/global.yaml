name: "Modular Wider Bridges Set"
description: |-
  This set replaces the three tubular bridges with three modular bridges that together can be used to visually make a wider bridge.

  Use in combination with a road/rail-set that provides overlay graphics for bridges.

  ISSUE:
  Cities and AI's will probably also build these bridges, but not as intended...
