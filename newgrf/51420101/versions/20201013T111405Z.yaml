description: |-
  This set adds three modular bridges that can be used to make wide bridges.
  Parameter settings can be used to choose to replace the three Tubular Bridges or to add them as three new bridges.

  Use in combination with a road/rail-set that provides overlay graphics for bridges.

  Possible Issue:
  Towns, GameScripts and AI's will probably build these bridges, but not as intended.
  Use this GRF in JGR PatchPack v0.38.1 or newer to avoid this issue.
