name: "paxCommuters"
description: |-
  This just renames the cargo "Passengers" to "Commuters", for use with separate "Tourists" cargo.

  It's also meant to be used with the "OpenGFX Mars" and other NewGRFs renaming passengers like "Wasteland" or any very old graphics that rename Passengers as "Tourists" instead of making a new Tourists cargo.

  Stolen from "Passengers as Workers" by scitor, who stole it from "Lumberjack Industries" by 2TallTyler
