  "Heavy Equipment" road vehicle set

  I like big trucks and thought it would be nice to have some for OpenTTD, so I created HEQS, including:

  *Nine enormous dump trucks (1955)
  *Two awesome log trucks (1972)
  *Ten powerful tractors and bulldozers (1937)
  *Two Foundry Transporters (1967)
  *Seven Industrial Trams (1869)
  *One very useful light truck for road & rail (1947/1958)
  *Forklift truck (1936)

  HEQS vehicles look good & range from 1t to huge.
  Compatible with FIRS, PBI and ECS
