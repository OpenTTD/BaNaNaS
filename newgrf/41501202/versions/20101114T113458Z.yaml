  "Heavy Equipment" road vehicle set

  I like big trucks and thought it would be nice to have some for OpenTTD, so I created HEQS, including:

  *Nine* enormous dump trucks (1955)
  *Two* awesome log trucks (1972)
  *Ten* powerful tractors and bulldozers (1937)
  *Two* Foundry Transporters (1967)
  *Three* Industrial Trams (1902)
  *One* very useful light truck for road *and* rail (1947/1958)

  HEQS has good-looking vehicles in sizes from 2t to 390t
  Compatible with FIRS, PBI and ECS
