  "Heavy Equipment" road vehicle set

  I like big trucks and thought it would be nice to have some for OpenTTD, so I created HEQS, including:

  *Nine* enormous dump trucks (starting 1955)
  *Two* awesome log trucks (starting 1972)
  *Ten* powerful tractors and bulldozers (starting 1937)
  *Two* Foundry Transporters (starting 1967).
  *Three* Industrial Trams (starting 1902).

  HEQS 0.8.0 has good-looking vehicles in a range of sizes from 19t to 390t.
  Compatible with FIRS, PBI and ECS.
