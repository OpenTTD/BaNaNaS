name: "Progressive Rail Set"
description: |-
  The Progressive Rail Set is a NewGRF that serves to make upgrading of larger, advanced rail systems easier. Assuming a progression of Normal Rail -> Electric Rail -> Monorail -> Maglev -> Vacuum Tube, an engine can now run (unpowered) on the generation of rail before it and run powered on its "normal rail" and the next generation of rail.

  As a side effect of these changes, you can run Maglev wagons with VacTrain engines.
