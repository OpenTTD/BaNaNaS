  Chinese-inspired headquarter buildings

  I created this 32bpp headquarters NewGRF in the Chinese New Year. This is a group of Chinese garden architecture, very suitable for as a headquarters building.  I increased a lot of holiday decorations on the building, including lantern, couplets, red carpet, etc .

  Hope you like it.
