  WIRES-Welcome Innovation Regarding Electricity Shipment.

  This is a test grf for electricity transmission; Electricity produced at power stations is transmitted by wires to substations located near towns. That's currently it; electricity has no special effect on town growth, industry production, etc. Note that there are numerous known issues, please see the forum thread for more info.

  While there are currently no plans for further development, this could change depending on user interest.
