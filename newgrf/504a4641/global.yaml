name: "Fake Airport Objects"
description: |-
  The Fake Airport Objects Set provides a lot of (modular) object tiles to create your own fake airport.
  Some tiles have multiple graphical representations.
  Place the same tile multiple times on the same spot to change the graphical representation.
  There are also some animated objects.
