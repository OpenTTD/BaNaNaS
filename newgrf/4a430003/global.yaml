name: "ISR 1.0.2 Bridgeable Mod"
description: |-
  Industrial Stations Renewal (ISR) is a set of stations with facilities suitable for freight cargo.

  A new feature has been added that allows bridges over stations in JGR Patch Pack v 0.26.0 and higher, or other packs that support this feature. The set will still function, without this feature, on OpenTTD 1.2.0 or greater.

  Modified by Wallyweb, based on the original work of the ISR development team on TT-Forums.
