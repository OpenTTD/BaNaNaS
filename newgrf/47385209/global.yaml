  Tired of little inconsistencies with road graphics?

  Remove those unsightly decorations from the bus and truck stations! Give your bridges a full tile ramp at each end! Use one way signs instead of arrows to mark your one way roads!

  Please note that this is meant for the use of NRT Roadtypes in JGR's Patch Pack; if used with default road graphics or vanilla OpenTTD it will reveal glitches in the matrix.
