description: |-
  A list of over 4,000 British place names that are at most six letters long. This list was created using data taken from the Gazetteer of British Place Names (https://gazetteer.org.uk/), which lists place names in Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland).
  I have removed a tiny number of place names that I deem to be overly generic, confusing or otherwise inappropriate in the context of OpenTTD.
