name: "TaI UK Houses Early Mod"
description: |-
  This a modification of the excellent Town and Industry - UK Houses, by PikkaBird. I just modified the NFO code a little.

  This version modifies the introduction date of several buildings, making this set suitable to start a game as early as 1000. Also, the population of several buildings to values that make more sense, allowing for smaller towns in the beginning of the game and delaying giant metropolis.

  Modification permission granted by PikkaBird.
