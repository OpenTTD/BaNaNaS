# BaNaNaS database

This is the production database for OpenTTD's content service, called BaNaNaS.
It works together with [bananas-api](https://github.com/OpenTTD/bananas-api), which serves the HTTP API.

See [introduction.md](https://github.com/OpenTTD/bananas-api/tree/master/docs/introduction.md) for more documentation about the different BaNaNaS components and how they work together.

**NOTE**: to make changes to your BaNaNaS content, use [the website](https://bananas.openttd.org); do not use Pull Requests for this purpose.
