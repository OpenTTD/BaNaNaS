description: |-
  Keep villages as villages! Villages Is Villages will stop every village from growing into a metropolis, and prevent industries from taking over the map.

  Towns are given a maximum population to which they can grow, and you will need to transport a (configurable) minimum amount of passengers and mail for them to grow at all. In order to grow a town beyond its initial limit, you will need to supply goods, building materials, or fund the town expansion yourself.
