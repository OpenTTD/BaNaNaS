name: "Schmitt City Growth"
description: "Fork of \"City Growth Limiter\". Now also requiring goods to make the city grow. (only valid for cities above 2000 population by default, by default requiring 1% of population as goods cargo to be received). Like the original mod \"City Growth Limiter\" there is also the need to transport passenger and mail in a sufficient way to make the city grow."
