description: |-
  Your company gets one point for each citizen you generate in any city by making the city grow.

  Cities grow when you supply at least x% of city's population size in tons.
  Thus bigger cities require higher cargo amounts.

  If you successfully supply minimum 100% of at least one cargo combi (both cargos of that combi),
  then your city grows at all.

  You can further speed a the city growth by supplying more than 150% of all currently supplied cargo combis.
