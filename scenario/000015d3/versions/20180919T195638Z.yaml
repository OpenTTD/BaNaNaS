  I'm a big fan of Featherblade's New Zealand Scenario. The shape of the islands means all the modes of transport are viable. However having learned that NZ has mostly single track lines
  I thought that would be an interesting challenge. However I found the map size meant it was a little cramped putting in
  passing places and big enough stations to handle the long trains.
