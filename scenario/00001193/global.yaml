  IRELAND - 1930
  By : Nekomaster

  I decide to try my hand at making a scenario based on Ireland.

  I know its not 100% accurate, but I tried my best. I mostly used google maps and wikipedia for locations of towns and some industry. Local industries where based on industrial area's I saw on Google Earth around towns.

  Enjoy the scenario!
