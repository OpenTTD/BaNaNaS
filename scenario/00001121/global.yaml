  Iceland (by Firecomet234)

  Iceland is a small Nordic country in the Atlantic Ocean of about 320,000 people. The capital, Reykjavik, is a charming city which quickly gives way to stunning waterfalls, fjords and mountains along with quaint towns and villages.

  With over 50 towns, realistic populations and industries and a unique terrain, it doesn't get much better than this.

  Grab your suitcase, because it's time to take a trip to the Land of Fire and Ice!
