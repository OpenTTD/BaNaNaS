name: "Dib's Motherlode"
description: |-
  In a distant tropical land, an astonishing wealth of diamonds has been discovered. The only catch: they're in the middle of a nearly impassible mountain range, hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest port. Earn starting capital by completing shorter links around St. Mary's, and then race to be the first railroad to reach Fortuna!

  Based on Grimdanfango's heightmap "The Mountain Pass" for Transport Fever.
