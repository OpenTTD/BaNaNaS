name: "New Zealand (1024x512)"
description: |-
  A scenario I made on a whim when I noticed there weren't any other full NZ scenarios!

  Based largely on a heightmap provided by Bob Smith on the forums, this Scenario prompts you to take on the rugged terrain of the deep south, or the bustling cities of the north:

  -The map is arctic.
  -Town's are 1/250th that of real life.
  -Industry is a mixture of realism + Gameplay.

  Hope you enjoy, ~FB
