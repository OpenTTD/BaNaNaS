  Winterwood Heights is a 256x256 mountainous river scenario based in the classic arctic landscape style, with the vanilla OpenTTD game. It's an attempt to make a more realistic looking river valley with many smaller side valleys.

  My personal goal when playing this scenario is to let trains follow valleys and slowly move up the mountains, and to avoid terraforming too much. In the central part the river valley is narrow, while north and south, the river valley is wide and has many cities and farms.
