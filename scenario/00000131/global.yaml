name: "New Zealand South Island"
description: "The South Island with Arctic/Alpine climate. Hopefully a challenge, provided you dont bulldoze the Southern Alps flat. Some valuable resources on the West coast, with all the industry on the East. There are only two power stations and one oil refinery. The towns are situated as close as I can get them, the industries roughly and intended to make a good game. You need to load George's ECS Wood vector that sites forests on broken terrain."
