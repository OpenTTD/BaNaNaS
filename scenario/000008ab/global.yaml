name: "TYD - Isles"
description: |-
  I noticed there aren't many maps that allow the player to focus on water-based transport. This is my attempt at making an island scenario. You'll probably need to transfer raw materials across the ocean since most forests/mines are located on one island and most factories/mills are found on the other.
  This map is part of TheYeIIowDucK's scenario series.
