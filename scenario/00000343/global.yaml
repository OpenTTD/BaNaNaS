name: "Saxony"
description: |-
  This is my version of the federal state Sachsen(Saxony) in Germany with the river Elbe, the well known cities of Dresden and Leipzig and even more you might not know, yet ;)

  Have fun and if there are questions and comments you can write an eMail (German or English) to articuno@magicstone.de

  The scenario should work with most of the openttd versions and without any modifications.
