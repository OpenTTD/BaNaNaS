name: "USA-Canada 4K ECS"
description: |-
  This is a 4K (4096x4096) size scenario that includes the most of USA and Canada, and a bit of Northern Mexico.

  You start in 1950 with ECS Vectors (industries) which will provide you with many different industries to serve and new cargos to transport. ECS predates FIRS and also plays differently.

  Enjoy playing with new industries and cargos! NekoMaster out
