name: "Mumbai - Industries"
description: |-
  Size: 1024x512
  This scenario is based on the heightmap of Mumbai, India. The suburbs are placed accurately plus a few industries, with some indicators to where things are supposed to go while playing (e.g. Airport, Metro, etc.).
  This scenario is geared towards an industry oriented gameplay.
  To play a passenger/mail public transport game, check out my "Mumbai - Suburbs" file in Scenarios. If you want just the heightmap, you can find it titled "Mumbai" under Heightmaps.
  Have fun!
