description: "After a passing fascination of with the island of Svalbard, I decided it would make an awesome OpenTTD map. Having only a handful of settlements, I had to take some artistic liberty and appropriate town names from nautical maps, regions, and historical data, but it's worth it when you create a transport empire spanning the map."
