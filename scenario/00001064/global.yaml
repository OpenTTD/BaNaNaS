name: "Australia and Timor (in 1930)"
description: "This map shows Australia and Timor in 1930. Trains are not yet available. Many settlements have not been founded yet, thus it is up to you to start them. As Dorothea Mackellar said \"I love a sunburnt country; a land of sweeping plains; of rugged mountain ranges; of droughts and flooding rains\" and you too will expand into this sunburnt country"
