name: "San Francisco Bay Area"
description: |-
  512 x 512 scale model of the San Francisco Bay Area, with terrain made from a roughly 100 x 100 km heightmap and hand-placed towns and industries.

  Towns are scaled to roughly 1/100th their real-life 2023 population, and placed appropriately on the map, with recognizable features when practical. Large cities are split into neighborhoods to get more realistic sprawl and for ease of building.

  This map uses FIRS 4 (>= 4.15.1) to get a more representative variety of industries for the Bay Area.
