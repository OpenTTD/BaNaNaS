  This is is a 1024x2048 map of Slovak republic based on real world terrain from Google Earth.
  Industries are basic, for infrastructure and vehicles and stations you will need some GFS, however.

  Contains most of the slovak cities and towns. Hungary, Czech rep.,Austria and Poland are less populated.

  Later when more height levels are available for the terrain, I will update version in arctic mode with higher alpine mountains. (height now is loughable)
