description: |-
  This is a map of La RÃ©union and Mauritius. 4096x1024.
  Heightmap generated by Tangram Heightmapper. Towns but no industries are placed. Japan Set and JP+ trains for a wide variety of short-distance rail transport, but the 1860 start would make players rely on road vehicles and ships in hard early years.
