name: "Something like New York"
description: "Scenario inspired by New York. Starts in 1940. Cities are smaller, so you can build your infrastructure easily. Names of cities taken from GTA 3, because I like them. Requires North American Roads and North American City Set, which can be downloaded manually as a part of ottdc_grfpack. Map by zelenycaj"
