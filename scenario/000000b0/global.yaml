  Europe
  Some details:

  Version needed: OpenTTD Nightly R15298 or higher
  Map size: 2048x2048
  Starting year: 1955
  Number of towns: 578
  Climate: Temperate
  This scenario is the latest version, using possibilities not available in earlier versions of OpenTTD; not compatible with OpenTTD 0.6.3 or lower

  Made by me, Myfineshrine, 2008.
  No use of a heightmap, only "drawn by hand" using a common atlas.
  Have a look at the german tt-forums for downloading other scenarios made by me also.
