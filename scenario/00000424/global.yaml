name: "Nintendo DS Lite"
description: |-
  A Nintendo DS Lite with several towns. I tried to make it as accurate as possible.

  - Mic
  - D-pad
  - Buttons (Including Start and Select)
  - Both Screens
  - Stylus (Island to the left)
  - Power Lights
  - Speakers

  Towns are based on the above areas, and have been named to help you identify them, although you shouldn't need any help.
