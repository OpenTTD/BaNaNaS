  Acadia was a French colony in what is now eastern Canada and Maine. In the mid-1700s, the British drove some 11,000 Acadians from their land; those who resettled in Louisiana became the Cajuns.

  In this scenario, the Acadians are left to live in peace. Start in 1750 with sailing ships, horse-drawn wagons, and horse-drawn rail vehicles.

  For early trains, you will need the Early Rail set (not on BaNaNaS):
