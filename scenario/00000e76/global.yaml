  Starting in 1930, you're tasked with building and managing your own transport company in the State of Florida, USA

  Inspired by the old Florida Scenario on the Wiki, made for OpenTTD 0.5.3, this new scenario offers a much larger (4 times larger) scenario with much more space and industry to play with.

  All NewGRFs should be available online.

  Enjoy!
