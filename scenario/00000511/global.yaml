description: |-
  An 512x512 arctic scenario with a mountain ridge going from north to south. The scenario features communication towers at the top of the mountain ridge so that it becomes impossible to cut a valley through it without cheating.

  The scenario uses a bunch of NewGRFs which all can be found through online content download. Just try to load the scenario and OpenTTD will help you find the missing NewGRFs.
