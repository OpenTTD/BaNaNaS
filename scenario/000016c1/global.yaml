  Welcome to Massachusetts! This is a 512x1024  map with real-world terrain (from a heightmap), town, and river placements. It includes almost all of Massachusetts (Lowell fell off the top) plus Rhode Island and northern Connecticut.

  It uses FIRS 3 industries on Temperate Basic, with representative placements. Suggested NewGRFs are loaded, however only FIRS is required.
