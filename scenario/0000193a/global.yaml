name: "Kanto Area, Japan"
description: |-
  Map of the Kanto area (Tokyo and surroundings) in Japan.

  Designed to take all of the advantages of Japanese NewGRF's, all the rivers and lakes were placed by hand trying to accurately mimic RL locations. Cities have 1% of their real life population. Tokyo is divided into the different Real Life wards, to make it easier to connect with transport.

  Took some creative license with industry placement, but following a real life logic.

  Have fun and enjoy!
