  Hi!
  This is Cornwallis Island scenario. Its based on Cornwallis Island in Nunavut, Canada.
  This scenario is pretty easy. Terrain is kinda flat and distances between industries are short.
  Since there's only one town (Resolute), passenger and mail services will be unprofitable early.
  I used heightmap (I couldn't find any other) with really bad resolution, so I modified seaside to look less blocky.
  Enjoy!
