  WARNING: ONLY USE WITH JGR PATCH PACK V0.37 OR GREATER. THIS WILL NOT RUN ON STANDARD OPENTTD CLIENT.

  Birth of an Empire is staged in the year 1860. You will bring modern progress to a vast area which has largely missed out on the 1st stage Industrial Revolution, but is now ready to enter into the 2nd stage. With almost no infrastructure, no connected primary industries and no secondary industries, you will need to carefully invest and manage resources in order to build a profitable empire. Good luck!
