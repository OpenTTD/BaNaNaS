name: "Scotland Scenario"
description: |-
  A scenario inspired by the original Scotland TTD Scenario. Also on a 256x256 map, but based on an actual heightmap. Manually placed cities as close to original as possible. Great with the original game and graphics.

  Credits
  The heightmap for this scenario was based on the UK heightmap by JonScaife (source: NASA). See viewtopic.php?f=60&t=42124
