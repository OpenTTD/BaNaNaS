description: |-
  This scenario is aimed for the average player. It's built in a way that imitates random generated town and industry placement while keeping a unique and realistic terrain. However, it is quite small, so don't rely on it for long-term gameplay.
  This map is part of TheYeIIowDucK's scenario series.
