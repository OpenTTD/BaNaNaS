description: "The Djursland peninsula of Jutland, Denmark. The single iron ore mine and two coal mines are placed on the location of real-world open pit gravel mines. Farms, forests and factories are randomly spread out. Lumbermills and powerplants are in real-world locations. TODO: move some towns around to fit the real world better; finish the northern and western parts."
