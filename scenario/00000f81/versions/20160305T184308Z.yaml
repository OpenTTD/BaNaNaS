description: "HUGE UPDATE - Removed ALL cities + industries and placed them again, fixing a lot of inconsistencies. Also redid most lakes and fixed the Gren√• river so it didn't connect all the way to Randers Fjord. All RL open pit digs are coal mines; all RL thermal plants are power plants; farms and factories peppered throughout; forests in mostly real locations; lumbermills in RL locations"
