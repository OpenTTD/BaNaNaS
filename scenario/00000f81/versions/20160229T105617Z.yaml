  UPDATED: the map has been filled out further, though I still have worth to do.

  The Djursland peninsula of Jutland, Denmark. The single iron ore mine and two coal mines are placed on the location of real-world open pit gravel mines. Farms, forests and factories are randomly spread out. Lumbermills and powerplants are in real-world locations.

  TODO: Tweak town locations further; finish northwestern areas; add more lakes and small streams
