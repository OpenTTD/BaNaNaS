description: "A map for running a transport corporation in the ATLA universe. The map is set circa 180 AG, after the conclusion of the Korra show. Thanks to u/ConservationOfWumbo for his very useful heightmap. Without it, this project would have taken much longer. Also thanks to ImageMagick for helping me make some transformations on said map to adapt it to OpenTTD."
