description: |-
  Map of Europe (2048x2048) - Includes Cities that are either big, famous (i.e. "known by me") or just fit well onto the map.
  From Lissabon to Riva, from Athens to Dublin, from Stockholm to Tunis.

  It uses some newGRFs that I would recommend, but nothing should break if you remove them in the editor before you start playing.
  I also recommend to randomly (or manually if you want) add industries before you start playing.

  Have fun!
