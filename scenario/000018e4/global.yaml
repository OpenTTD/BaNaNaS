name: "MTA and NJTransit Map"
description: |-
  This is a map of the New York City metro area specifically inclusive of all the end points of the Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road in addition to the northern parts of the NJ Transit network.

  This scenario was made with no industries or even NewGRFs in the interest of making it a useful 'base' for building a scenario on top of it.
