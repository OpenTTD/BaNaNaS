name: "Saxony Switzerland"
description: |-
  This is a region within Germany near Dresden at the river Elbe which is famous for its beautiful nature. (Nationalpark SÃ¤chsische Schweiz / Saxony Switzerland)

  In the map are parts of Dresden and all the towns and landscapes in the southeast till the border. I choose this region because it's my home.
