name: "Sundhelm Strait"
description: |-
  Fictional scenario consisting of large bays, coastal plains and several mountain ranges divided between Anglic and Gaelic-inspired cultures.

  Uses FIRS industries and complimentry vehicle sets. Towns and Industries are balanced so that they should be fun and not too frustrating to connect and get the whole map working.
