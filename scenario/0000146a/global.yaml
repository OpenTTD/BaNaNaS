name: "Middle Earth"
description: |-
  Big 'ol Scenario of Middle Earth (Lord of the Rings). From the Haradwaith to the Forodwaith; from Lindon to Dorwinion. Places are lore-friendly as far as possible with some extras taken from MERP and other semi-canon sources. I've tried to keep towns to a manageable size and industries placement should give interesting gameplay.

  Uses FIRS industry and complimentary station and vehicle sets.
