name: "Bernese Oberland, Switzerland"
description: |-
  Interlaken is a city in the Swiss Alps, nested between lakes and mountains. This scenario includes the surrounding area: large lakes, many settlements, high mountains, and even the Jungfraujoch mountain outpost.

  These are my favourite mountains and offer lots of different terrain. The NewGRFs used are similar to the existing Switzerland scenarios.
