description: |-
  Build your own East Empire Company! A very detailed heightmap-based scenario covering the entire continent of Tamriel from Summerset Isle to Vvardenfell and Solstheim. Towns and roads have been placed as accurately as possible and I have varied the terrain and tree types to hopefully give forests in different regions a different feel from each other. :)

  -1024x1024 Temperate Climate
  -Starting year 1935
  -Uses FIRS Industries and complimentary non-default vehicle sets.
