description: |-
  Gives a paced but basic endurance challenge. Set in the UK & Ireland with an early start. Most real UK towns exist with low populations. Link and grow them!

  1 (default) coal mine and 1 power plant exist initially to get you started. More industries will spawn.

  UKRS2 provides trains until 2020, when default Maglevs and later VacTube trains appear until 2080-ish.

  NewGRF selection can be changed in the scenario editor with "set scenario_developer 1" in the console.
