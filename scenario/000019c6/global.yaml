  A modified "Yet another UK" 4K scenario

  With almost all towns/villages that contain a National Rail train station included, major cities split into major suburbs for better metro, plus some other towns and locations (mostly to fill in emptier areas)

  The aim of this map is to be able to recreate the modern UK passenger network

  Beta version, testing and modifications are ongoing
