name: "USA-Canada 4K NAIS"
description: |-
  This is a 4K (4096x4096) size scenario that includes the most of USA and Canada, and a bit of Northern Mexico.

  You start in 1950 with my very own North American Industry Set (NAIS), which provides players with many different industries and cargos based on North American industry.

  Since NAIS is based on FIRS 3.X.X code, the game play should be similar to FIRS 3.X.X

  Enjoy playing with new industries and cargos! NekoMaster out!
