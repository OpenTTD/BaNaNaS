description: |-
  A map inspired by the railroads of Colorado, USA. Industries and towns are placed in logical locations, resulting in a realistic network. NARS and NAIS provide american flavor.

  In my opinion this is my best map; it's the one that has engaged me the longest as a player.

  Does not require JGR's.

  Based on the Transport Fever map "Map21" by Luk0r
