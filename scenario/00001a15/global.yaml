name: "Crossing the Alps"
description: |-
  This scenario picks up the central part of the Alps, while it aims to recreate the spirit of the challenge of crossing the mountains some years before.

  DEM data with adjustments forms the terrain.
  Towns, rivers and streets are set manually. Industry is fictional; and mostly separated in north and south to make crossing the mountains interesting.

  Lets bring Italian cuisine to Germany in exchange of  quality goods from the north.

  1 tile = 50km
  1 height level = 100m
