name: "USA-Canada 4K VANILLA INDUSTRY"
description: |-
  This is a 4K (4096x4096) size scenario that includes the most of the USA and Canada, and a bit of Northern Mexico.

  You start in 1950 with Vanilla industries but using OpenGFX industries, several industries from the other climates will appear as well.

  I spent 2-3 months on this scenario and I hope you people enjoy it!
