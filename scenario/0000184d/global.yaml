name: "Wellington, NZ - 1024x1024"
description: |-
  Based on the real world city of Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Includes all major satellite towns as far as Paraparaumu and Upper Hutt + many suburbs.

  NOTE: Towns building roads is set to 'off' by default to prevent growth into the limited flat space. Turn this on for a more challenging gameplay.
