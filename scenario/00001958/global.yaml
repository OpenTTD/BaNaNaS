  Hi!
  This is Ellesmere Island scenario. Its based on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.
  This scenario is pretty difficult - there are only three towns, mountainious terrain and sparse of industries. Start year is 1880.
  I used heightmap with low resolution.. I placed towns accurately. Industries were placed randomly.
  Enjoy!

  Note: Eureka is town in-game althrough its meteorological station in real world. But I was through: "Nah, with two towns, it will be boring."
regions:
- "CA-NU"
- "US"
