  A large 4096x4096 tile
  map of Australia for
  your down under transport
  pleasure.

  OpenGFX INdustries Version

  Mostly uses IRL location
  of industries though some
  industries had to be
  replaced with OpenGFX
  stuff like IRL sawmills
  being placed as papermills
  or Alumnium mines and smelters
  being replaced with Iron Mines
  and Steel mills.

  ENJOY!!!
