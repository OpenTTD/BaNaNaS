  Hi!
  This is Ellesmere Island scenario. Its based on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.
  This scenario is pretty hard - terrain is mountainious, there's sparse of industries and only five small towns.
  I used height map with pretty good resolution, but terrain is not 100% accurate. Industries are random. Enjoy!

  Note: Eureka, Alexandra Fiord and Hazen Camp are meteorological or research stations in real life.
