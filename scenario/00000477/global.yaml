name: "Sweden Scenario"
description: |-
  This scenario includes all of Sweden and some parts of Norway, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lituania.
  The Scenario is semi-realistic, the lakes and rivers are larger than in real life to generate the feeling of difficulty to cross rivers and lakes. The industries/raw-material are also semi realistic. Some of them exist in real Sweden, but most of them dont and are added by me for playability.

  Enjoy!
