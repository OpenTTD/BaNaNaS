name: "England and Wales Scenario"
description: |-
  A map of England & Wales featuring hundreds of cities and a number of manually-placed industries, such as North Sea oil, as well as several major rivers.

  This scenario balances realism and playability so the cities are not to scale, ensuring that London does not dwarf other cities. Industries are placed with a mixture of realism and playability in mind.

  This scenario contains a number of newGRFs, all of which are available on the Online Content Service.
