description: |-
  A map of England and Wales featuring a number of manually-placed industries including North Sea oil, south Welsh coal etc.

  This scenario balances realism and playability so the cities are not to scale, ensuring that London does not dwarf other cities. Industries are placed with a mixture of realism and playability in mind.

  Made in 1.0.0-beta4.

  Total Town Replacement Set is not required to play this scenario but it is highly recommended.
