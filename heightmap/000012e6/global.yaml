name: "Flat Naturally Shaped Islands"
description: |-
  A collection of mostly flat, yet naturally shaped islands in an expanse of sea with some low hills and lakes for variety. Try adding "Few" rivers!

  2048 x 2048, but also works with smaller map sizes.

  Made in Photoshop by tracing shapes of various real islands around the world, then combining, resizing and rotating them to make original shapes while retaining a "natural" look.
