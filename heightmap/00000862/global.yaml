name: "Australia, Victoria"
description: |-
  Heightmap of the Australian state, Victoria.

  Verison 2.0 includes the states of Victoria and Tasmania, and a portion of South Australia. The North-West end of the map should roughly follow the Murray River's path (also meaning that portions of New South Wales are included).

  Version 1.0 of the heightmap included a much larger portion of New South Wales, but lacked Tasmania, and the terrain was too rough. This has been fixed in 2.0.
