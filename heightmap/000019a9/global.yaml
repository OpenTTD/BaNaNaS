  Barrier islands, rivers, and natural harbors tested to ensure correct water passage generation.

  Some rivers are not fully navigable on purpose and require player investment to fully utilize.

  Designed for 4096 x 4096 maps. 2048 x 2048 works as well but a few rivers shut early, and barrier islands connect to the mainland and each other.
