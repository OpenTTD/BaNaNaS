name: "Hokkaido, 1 tile:75m"
description: |-
  Heightmap of the Japanese island Hokkaido, from the STRM 1 project.

  If you use this on a 8k by 8k size, 1 tile will represent 75x75 metres. If you use 4k by 4k, 1 tile will be 150x150 metres and so on.

  Works with any max heights. For 'real' height, use between 40-80 on 8k by 8k.

  Thanks to OpenTopography and NASA.
