description: |-
  Heightmap of Portugal and North-West Spain, from the STRM 1 project.

  If you use this on a 4k by 8k size, 1 tile will represent 100x100 metres. If you use 2k by 4k, 1 tile will be 200x200 metres and so on.

  Works with any max heights. For 'real' height, use 30 on 4k by 8k.

  Thanks to OpenTopography and NASA.
