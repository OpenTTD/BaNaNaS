name: "Cpt.K's Patchwork Isles"
description: |-
  A square map that's great for multiplayer games. A large variety of landscapes, from jagged coasts and smooth rises, to sharp peaks and rolling hills, populate an idyllic island chain. Suitable for all climates.
  For 2048x2048 games, a max height of 50 or above is recommended.
