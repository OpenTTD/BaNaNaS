name: "Taiwan, 1 tile:50m"
description: |-
  Heightmap of Taiwan, from the STRM 1 project.

  Works with max height up to 127.

  If you use this on a 4k by 8k size, 1 tile will represent 50x50 metres. If you use 2k by 4k, 1 tile will be 100x100 metres and so on.

  Thanks to OpenTopography and NASA.
