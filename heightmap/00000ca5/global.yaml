name: "Austraterra and Boreaterra 1k"
description: |-
  Two large continents with just enough water between them to make bridges seem impractical. There are a few smaller islands as well.

  The continents feature some relatively flat plains, and some small mountains. Valleys allow inland rivers to flow to the sea which might otherwise be trapped by hills.

  This heightmap is 1024×512. Also available in 2048×1024.
