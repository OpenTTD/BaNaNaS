  4096×2048 Heightmap of the World (excluding Antarctica)

  • Winkel Tripel projection (better balance between area, angle and distance than the traditional Mercator projection)
  • Accurate coastlines based on GSHHS data
  • Accurate but non-linear topography based on ETOPO data (hills are higher and mountains lower; for better gameplay)
  • Centred 10° east of the prime meridian (to make the map split in the middle of the Bering Sea rather than the Kamchatka Peninsula)
