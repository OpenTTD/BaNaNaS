name: "Cpt.K's Meandering Islands"
description: |-
  A 1:2 rectangular map of a sparse chain of islands with plenty of flat land. A central dormant volcano is the only significant elevation. Suitable for all climates.
  For 2048x4096 games, a max height of 25 produces a fairly flat map with a few prominent hills.
