name: "Africa & Parts of the Mid. East"
description: |-
  A large 4096x4096 heightmap of Africa with bits of the middle east and parts of south Italy and Spain.

  It will also work fairly well at 2048x2048 (I've tested both sizes very well)

  Its not the most accurate map, but I have yet to see other maps that include the entirety of Africa for OpenTTD.

  I apologize for inaccuracies with mountains, hills, and rivers (some may be in the wrong place or shouldn't exist on the map)
