description: |-
  A bigger heightmap of Europe, 4096 pixels long and wide. Why? So if you have the extra-large-map patch you can use this if you think the 2048 x 2048 map of Europe is too small. Of course, this map can be played at smaller maps (with good quality) if you prefer OpenTTD trunk instead.

  ---Changelog---

  V3 - Made it much more hilly

  V2 - Fixed the Netherlands (much better Flevoland + Afsluitdijk), and a few lakes here and there
