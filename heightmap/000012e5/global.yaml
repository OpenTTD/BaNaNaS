name: "Flatter UK & Ireland, 2048 x 20"
description: |-
  A flatter map of the United Kingdom, designed for easier gameplay.

  Set the "Maximum Map Height" to 15 and hills won't go higher than 4 tiles above sea level.

  Made in Photoshop by manually tracing over various maps. Mountains were painted over an elevation map using a brush type (for a more natural look!) and are approximate.

  Orkney Isles and France are not included.
