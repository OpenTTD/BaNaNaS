description: |-
  this is a heightmap of the whole martian surface based on the public domain map supplied by NASA on http://www.solarviews.com/cap/mgs/mgstopo3.htm
  Colours don't yet translate 100% correctly into the elevation, but the main features come out just fine. Recommended: artic with snowline not below 6
