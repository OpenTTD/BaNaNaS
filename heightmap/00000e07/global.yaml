name: "France (4096 x 4096)"
description: |-
  Enjoy la Métropole in 4096^2 tiles! Also includes la Suisse romande/Alps, parts of southern England, Belgium, the Pyrenees, northern coast of Spain, Piedmont, and Liguria.

  Of course, this map can be downscaled to 2048 x 2048 tiles (with good quality) if you prefer playing at a smaller map for faster gameplay.
