description: |-
  Heightmap of the Czech Republic, from the STRM 1 project.

  If you use this on a 4k by 8k size, 1 tile will represent 66.7x66.7 metres. If you use 2k by 4k, 1 tile will be 132x132 metres and so on.

  WARNING: This map has no sea-level tiles. If you're playing with an industry set that needs water-based industries, consider using an alternative industry set (e.g., XIS instead of FIRS 3).

  Thanks to OpenTopography and NASA.
