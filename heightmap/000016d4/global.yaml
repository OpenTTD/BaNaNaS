name: "Greater Brittania (fictional)"
description: |-
  This is a heightmap loosely inspired by the UK (yes I know, creative name for it), but is a land mass I've been evolving for a few years now.

  It mainly consists of a long island with chains of islands in the north, and a large island to the south. The south generally consists of flatter rough terrain with patches of hills, and as you go further north it gets more mountainous.

  Recommended play is 2k by 4k with a height between 16 and 24.
